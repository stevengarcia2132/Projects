#sales analysis
This past summer I worked for Prime Pest and Lawn as a sales representative.
I thought it would be intersting to analyze the data from the accounts that I created.
The data originally included some personal information such as full name and address so I dropped some
columns to keep confidentiality. 

The first part of code consists of data cleaning and sorting.
The second part is the data visualisation of my sales per month and by day of the week.
